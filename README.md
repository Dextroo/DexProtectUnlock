Dextro's Avatar Protection System Unlocker

This is a very basic MelonLoader mod intended to write the unlocking parameters for the Avatar Protection System when an avatar is loaded. More details about the Protection System can be found at https://gum.co/DexProtect.

Hopefully with the VRChat OSC update, if local parameter support is added this mod will become obsolete and the Protection System can operate within VRChat TOS. As for now running this mod is done at your own risk and does violate the TOS. The author assumes no responsibility for action taken against your VRChat account if you use this mod.
